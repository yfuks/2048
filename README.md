# ft_2048
ft_2048 is a modest copy of original 2048 game. It was made at 42 scool PARIS by a first year student (me)

This copy was realised for the rush "wong_kar_wai" in 2 days with the ncurses library, then uptdated by myself from now on

This software can handle :
- High Scores
- Screen resize
- Signals (like ctrl + c for exemple)
- "kind of" slips
- Somes beautiful menus
